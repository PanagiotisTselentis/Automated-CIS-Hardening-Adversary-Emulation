This same registry location and value was also created if the setting Ensure 'LSA Protection' is set to 'Enabled' was also applied. This appears to have been a mistake in the ADMX/ADML Templates for that release. Starting with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 24H2 Administrative Templates, the setting Configures LSASS to run as a protected process has a new registry location of HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System. In addition, the setting LSA Protection will be displayed by GPME when this setting (Configures LSASS to run as a protected process) is configured. If Configures LSASS to run as a protected process was configured using an older version of the ADML/ADML templates, the new registry location will not auto-apply to the system, and assessment scans using the latest benchmark might fail. To fix this issue, the ADMX/ADML templates must be updated to the latest version, the setting removed from the GPO, and then added back in. If the Microsoft Windows 10 Benchmark is applied, LSA Protection is configured via a separate recommendation for older versions of the Windows 10 Operating System using the SecGuide.admx/adml templates. That configuration is checked for separately from this recommendation."
